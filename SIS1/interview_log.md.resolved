### The Interview Transcript

**Me:** Aibek, thanks for joining. I know you're busy. I'm looking at the data, and the average time from "Request" to "Contract" is 45 days. Can you tell me what the hardest part of that process is for *you*?

**Aibek:** Honestly? It's the "Technical Compliance" phase. It kills me. I spend 70% of my week on it.

**Me:** Okay, let's drill into that. **(1) Why does Technical Compliance take 70% of your week?**

**Aibek:** Because for every tender, I get maybe 5 to 10 vendors applying. each one validates a "Technical Specification" (TZ). They upload scanned PDFs, certificates, weird layouts. I have to read every single page to check if they match our requirements.

**Me:** **(2) Why do you have to read every page manually? Can't the portal check it?**

**Aibek:** *Laughs.* The portal? The portal is just a file cabinet. It lets them upload *anything*. It doesn't know if the "ISO 9001" certificate expired last week. It doesn't know if the "Local Content Share" calculation is wrong. I have to find those details with my own eyes.

**Me:** I see. **(3) Why is it so critical that you catch every single minor error yourself?**

**Aibek:** Because if I miss *one* thing—like a missing stamp or a wrong date—and I approve it, the Legal Department will reject it 2 weeks later. Or worse, the "Samruk-Kazyna" auditors come in 6 months later and fine us for "Improper Verification." So I play it safe. I check everything three times.

**Me:** That sounds stressful. **(4) Why does Legal reject it 2 weeks later instead of checking it with you?**

**Aibek:** Legal is swamped too. They are the gatekeepers. They don't see the tender until I say it's "clean." So they treat me as the first filter. If I send them garbage, they yell at my boss. So I delay sending it until I'm 100% sure. But I'm tired, so I work slow.

**Me:** So the root cause is the fear of error in checking unstructured data. **(5) Why haven't we standardized the input so vendors can't upload "garbage"?**

**Aibek:** We tried! But the vendors are small shops, sometimes just a guy with a truck. They can't fill out complex web forms. They just scan the paper documents they have. We can't change the vendors, and we can't change the laws. So I am the human OCR.

### The Insight (Root Cause)

**The Problem isn't "Slow Procurement."**
**The Problem is:** High-stakes, manual verification of unstructured vendor data against complex, changing compliance rules.

**The Opportunity:** An agent that "reads" the scans *for* Aibek and highlights the risks before he even opens the file.
