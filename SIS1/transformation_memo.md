# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** The Board of Directors, Kazakhstan Temir Zholy (KTZ)
**FROM:** Head of Cloud Transformation
**DATE:** January 24, 2026
**SUBJECT:** TRANSFORMATION DIAGNOSIS: Why "Digital KTZ" is Stalled (And How to Fix It)

## 1. THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM

We are running a 21st-century logistics strategy with a 20th-century "IT Service" mindset.

Our analysis of the 2023-2024 Strategic Development Plan reveals a critical structural flaw: **KTZ treats technology as a cost center to be managed, not a product to be cultivated.**

We are currently optimizing for **Output** (deploying SAP modules, launching portals on time), whereas a modern Product Operating Model optimizes for **Outcome** (reducing wagon turnaround time, cutting procurement cycle duration).

## 2. THE CAGAN AUDIT: DIAGNOSIS OF GAPS

Applying the principles of the Product Operating Model (Cagan), we identified three existential gaps in our current approach:

### Gap 1: Mercenaries vs. Missionaries (The Team Problem)
*   **Evidence:** The Annual Report lists "IT Division" as a support function separate from "Freight Operations." Digital projects are "handed off" to vendors or IT with strict requirements (Business Requirement Documents).
*   **The Anti-Pattern:** We have "Mercenary Teams"—they build exactly what they are told. If the feature fails to solve the business problem, they are not held responsible; they just checked the box.
*   **Result:** A disconnect between the people writing code and the people moving trains.

### Gap 2: The "Project Roadmap" Trap (The Strategy Problem)
*   **Evidence:** The "Digital Transformation Strategy" is a list of 50+ deliverables (e.g., "Implement Document Management System Phase 2").
*   **The Anti-Pattern:** We are funding **projects**, not **products**. When a project "ends," the team is disbanded, leaving the software to rot (maintenance mode).
*   **Result:** We celebrate "Go-Live" parties for software that employees hate using.

### Gap 3: Validation Theater (The Discovery Problem)
*   **Evidence:** No mention of "User Research," "Prototyping," or "Usability Testing" in the 200-page report. Risks are managed by *compliance* (Legal/Financial reviews), not by *validation*.
*   **The Anti-Pattern:** We assume we know the solution. We spend millions building full-scale systems before checking if they actually solve the root problem for the station manager or procurement officer.
*   **Result:** High "Change Management" costs because we force-feed unwanted tools to staff.

## 3. THE STRATEGIC PIVOT: 3 RECOMMENDATIONS

To become the "Digital Silk Road," we must shift from **Project-Led** to **Product-Led**:

1.  **Pilot "Empowered Product Teams"**: Select *one* critical problem (e.g., "Procurement Efficiency"). Create a cross-functional team (Product Manager + Tech Lead + Designer) and give them a *problem to solve*, not a *solution to build*.
    *   *Goal:* "Reduce procurement processing time by 30%," not "Launch the new portal."

2.  **Institutionalize "Product Discovery"**: Mandate a "Discovery Phase" for all capital tech investments > 50M KZT. Teams must demonstrate evidence of value (customer interviews, prototypes) *before* writing production code.

3.  **Governance Shift**: Move from "Funding Projects" to "Funding Value Streams." Stop allocating budget to "IT Features"; allocate budget to "Freight Efficiency" and let the Product Leaders decide the best features to achieve it.

**CONCLUSION**

KTZ has the scale and the mandate. What we lack is the *operating model*. We cannot buy "Digital Transformation" from a vendor; we must build the muscle internally.

**Next Step:** Launch the "Deep Discovery" Pilot in Procurement to demonstrate this new way of working.
