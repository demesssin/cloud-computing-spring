# MANAGERIAL DEFENSE: GO/NO-GO DECISION

**Project:** ProcureGuard (AI Compliance Agent)
**Decision:** ✅ **GO**
**Risk Level:** Low (with on-premise mitigation)

---

## 1. FINANCIAL REASONING (The ROI Case)

We are not building this because "AI is cool." We are building this because manual verification is bleeding money.

### The Cost of Inaction (Current State)
*   **Average Salary of Procurement Specialist:** 450,000 KZT/month (~2,800 KZT/hour).
*   **Time Spent on Technical Compliance:** 70% of work week (28 hours/week).
*   **Team Size:** 50 Specialists across KTZ subsidiaries.
*   **Annual Cost of Validation:**
    *   28 hours * 2,800 KZT * 52 weeks * 50 people = **203,840,000 KZT / year** spent just reading PDF scans.

### The Value of the Agent
*   **Efficiency Gain:** Agent reduces validation time from 4 hours to 10 minutes (95% reduction). Conservatively, we validatethat we save **20 hours/week** per person.
*   **Hard Savings:**
    *   20 hours * 2,800 KZT * 52 weeks * 50 people = **145,600,000 KZT / year** in recovered productivity.
*   **Soft Savings:** Avoidance of Samruk-Kazyna audit fines (avg fine: 5-10M KZT per infraction).

### ROI Calculation
*   **Estimated Build Cost:** 30,000,000 KZT (3 months, 4-person team).
*   **Year 1 Net Benefit:** 145M Savings - 30M Cost = **+115,000,000 KZT**.
*   **Payback Period:** < 3 Months.

## 2. GOVERNANCE & ETHICS (The "Kazakhstan AI" Check)

We must comply with the *Law on Informatization* and emerging AI regulations in Kazakhstan.

### A. Data Residency (Critical)
*   **Risk:** Sending contract data to OpenAI/Claude servers in the USA violates internal KTZ security protocols and potentially KZ law regarding strategic enterprise data.
*   **Mitigation:** We will **NOT** use public APIs for confidential documents.
    *   *Solution:* Deploy a localized Open Source model (e.g., Llama 3 8B or Mistral) hosted on **KTZ's private on-premise servers** (Green Data Center). No data leaves the perimeter.

### B. Algorithmic Transparency ("Explainability")
*   **Risk:** The Agent rejects a valid vendor, and the vendor sues KTZ for unfair treatment.
*   **Mitigation:** The "Human-in-the-Loop" Protocol.
    *   The Agent *never* rejects a vendor automatically. It only **flags risks** for Aibek.
    *   Aibek makes the final decision. The AI provides citations ("See Page 42"). This ensures legal accountability remains with the human officer.

### C. Language Support
*   **Requirement:** Documents are in mixed Russian and Kazakh.
*   **Mitigation:** The model must be fine-tuned or prompted specifically for **official/legal Kazakh** (State Language) semantic understanding, not just generic translation.

## 3. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

We have a clear path to **100M+ KZT** annual value with manageable risk.
The technology is mature. The business need is urgent.
The only blocker is our willingness to change the operating model to build it.

**Recommendation:** Approve "Discovery Phase" budget (5M KZT) immediately.
